# Dashing widget for FITBITÂ®

Fitbit widget for [Dashing](http://shopify.github.com/dashing), which uses the [Fitgem](https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem) gem to retrieve information from the [Fitbit API](https://dev.fitbit.com/). It displays today's steps (with the percentage of today's goal), the lifetime (total) steps, today's distance (with the percentage of today's goal), the lifetime (total) distance, today's calories burned (with the percentage of today's goal) and the very active minutes of the day. An example of some of these can be viewed [below](https://github.com/kevintuhumury/dashing-fitbit#preview)

## Dependencies

[Fitgem](https://github.com/whazzmaster/fitgem) is a dependency of the Fitbit widget. So, add `fitgem` to the Gemfile of your Dashing dashboard:

```ruby
gem "fitgem"
```

and run `bundle install`.

## Authorization

## Usage

To use this widget, copy `fitbit.coffee`, `fitbit.html` and `fitbit.sass` into the `/widgets/fitbit` directory of your dashboard. Copy both `fitbit.png` and `fitbit-icons.png` to the `/assets/images` directory, put the `/jobs/fitbit.rb` file in the `/jobs` folder and the `lib/fitbit.rb` file into the `lib` directory. If there isn't one yet, create it.

Now, if you haven't already authorize the widget over at the Fitbit website as described above. Once that's done, you should be able to start using it!

## Configuration

By default the Fitbit widget will use the Metric system and displays the last sync time as hh:mm. You're able to adjust those settings though.

```ruby
# widget configuration

unit_system = "METRIC"
date_format = "%H:%M"
```

The `unit_system` in the above configuration can be changed to `en_US`, `en_GB` or can be removed. The fitgem will then start using the default, which is `en_US`. The `date_format` can be changed to something of your liking. It's a `DateTime`, so you could include the date also.
